Aim: To study and implement C++ arrays and strings.

Tools: VS code.

# Theory:

What is an Array?

An array is a data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable instead of declaring separate variables for each value. In C++, arrays are declared with a specified size, and elements are accessed using indices starting from 0.

# Key Features:

Stores elements in contiguous memory locations.

Fixed size defined at the time of declaration.

Access elements using index notation `arr[i]`.

# Types of Arrays:

One-dimensional array: Linear collection of elements.

Multi-dimensional array: 2D arrays representing matrices.

# Program 1: Input and Display Array

Algorithm:

Declare an array of fixed size.

Use a loop to take input values from the user.

Store each input value into the array.

Use another loop to print the array elements.

# Program 2: Search for a Key in Array

Algorithm:

Start

Prompt the user to enter the size of the array n

Read the value of n

Declare an array numbers of size n

Repeat for i = 0 to n-1

Prompt the user to enter the i-th value

Read numbers[i]

Prompt the user to enter the key to be searched

Read the key

Repeat for i = 0 to n-1

If numbers[i] == key then

Print i+1 as the position of the key in the array

End

# Program 3: Reverse an Array














# Program 5: Find Maximum and Minimum in Array
Problem Statement: Write a code to find the maximum and minimum value in the array.

Algorithm:

Take the number of elements from the user.

Input the elements into an array.

Initialize two variables max and min with the first array element.

Loop through the array and update max and min accordingly.

Display the results.
